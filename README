This is the source for the Google App Engine application at http://www.youfollow.me

This application was built by 

Mathieu Perreault (mathieu.perreault@gmail.com)
Marc Beaupre (marc.pn.beaupre@gmail.com)

as part of a 2-day hackathon in October 2010.

As such, this application is not tested and was coded hastily. Nevertheless, it works and the results can be observed on http://www.youfollow.me

Some files were ommitted (such as library JARs) but README files were added to point where they should be added.

We recommend not to directly copy this project since the App Engine structure may have changed since 2010, but it can serve as a good pointer as to the structure of an App Engine application.
